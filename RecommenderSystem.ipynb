    "The approach is the item-based K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm. Its philosophy is as follows: \n",
    "in order to determine the rating of User on Products, we can find other products that are similar to product rating, and based on User ratings on those similar product we infer his rating on Product. KNN finds the nearest K neighbors of each Product under the defined similarity function, and use the weighted means to predict the rating. "

An encoded vector is returned with a length of the entire vocabulary and an integer count for the number of times each word appeared in the document. Stop words are words like “and”, “the”, “him”, which are presumed to be uninformative in representing the content of a text, and which may be removed to avoid them being construed as signal for prediction. Sometimes, however, similar words are useful for prediction, such as in classifying writing style or personality."

The reason why we preferred item based approach over user based approach is because User-based approach is often harder to scale because of the dynamic nature of users, whereas items usually don’t change much, and item based approach often can be computed offline and served without constantly re-training.\n",
